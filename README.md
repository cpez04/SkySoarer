After each change, execute the following in the terminal:
1. git commit [file name]
2. when the terminal shows "hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file...", type a commit message (i.e. what changes you implemented) in the newly opened window, then close the window.
3. git push

* have to execute git commit for EVERY file that you changed. (until we find an easier way to implement these changes)
